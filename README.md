# scratchcode
A public repo to share solutions to pain in the ass problems and hopefully decrease the pain in the ass factor for someone.

## SQL ALchemy
Can't say that I am a huge fan of SQLA. I don't have an issue writing DDL and SQL and making DB modifications, most of my needs are simple. The complexity of SQLA outweighs the benefits for me.  

I've been stuck using it in a few cases and so have had to deal with it way more than I would like. The sqla_scratch.py outlines DB creation, CRUD mixins and details some tricker aspects of getting it to work. This is Postgres specific because it uses PG Arrays.
